# FO4 spikes: deciding whether FO3/FNV on Fallout 4 is buildable

Design only; status is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The findings behind this
plan are in [research/fo4_target.md](research/fo4_target.md).

## <a id="order"></a>Order and why

Spikes come before more exe reading. The [AI rules](research/fo4_target.md#ai-rules)
read so far settled the one question exe work could decide: FO4's AI
decisions are Skyrim's. The questions that could still sink the project are
on the content side, ordered by how decisive each is:

1. **Dialogue (spike 1).** Can FO3/FNV dialogue be generated for FO4 at all?
   This is go/no-go.
2. **Scripts (spike 3).** How big is the script back end? Runs in parallel
   with spike 1 and needs none of your play time.
3. **Assets (spike 2).** What does the mesh/material/collision/FaceGen back end
   really cost? Only worth paying for once spike 1 passes.

Exe reading resumes where a spike needs it. Spike 1 plays a force greet, which
settles R10 by observation.

## <a id="step-0"></a>Step 0: groundwork

| Piece | What |
|---|---|
| FO4 plugin writer | `fo4_import/base/writer.py`: `FO4PluginWriter` (form version 131, FO4 header with HEDR 1.0, INTV and INCC, FO4 top-level group order), plus `pack_quest()` / `pack_topic()` for FO4's nesting. Dialogue has no top-level group: each QUST is followed by a quest-children group (type 10) holding DLBR, then DIAL with its INFO group (type 7), then SCEN, in vanilla's order. Tests: `tests/test_fo4_writer.py` |
| Vanilla dump | `references/Fallout4.esm/`: all 138 record types, 558 MB, from `tools/esm/tes5_esm_reader.py --generic`. The `--generic` switch skips the tool's Skyrim field layouts and condition names, so FO4 fields show as raw FormID/uint/float/hex rather than mislabelled Skyrim fields. FO4-specific decoders get added as spikes need them |
| Script sources | `references/fo4_scripts/Base` (Base, the six DLC and Creation Club zips, 10,258 files, with `Institute_Papyrus_Flags.flg`) and `references/fo4_scripts/F4SE` (29 files). Import order: F4SE first, then Base |
| Compiler | Fallout 4's own `Papyrus Compiler\PapyrusCompiler.exe`. A smoke script with a struct, a timer and F4SE's `Form.GetEditorID` compiles. The vendored `external/papyrus-compiler/papyrus.exe` is Skyrim-only: it stops at the first `Struct` |

Known gap: `tes5_import.base.tes5_reader.walk(raw, b'DIAL')` (a *filtered*
walk) prunes group type 10 as Skyrim cell children, so it misses every FO4
topic. Unfiltered walks, and the dump tool, see them. An FO4 reader needs its
own child-group table.

## <a id="spike-1"></a>Spike 1: dialogue (go/no-go)

Generated from the FNV export by code, not built by hand in the CK.

- **1a. Doc Mitchell's opening conversation**, as XDI-enabled scenes:
  - the topic list, with more than four options;
  - SPECIAL and skill checks;
  - a silent player;
  - the force greet, played, to settle R10;
  - his voice lines as `.fuz` with lip data.

  The speaker is a vanilla FO4 NPC base in a test cell, so no converted
  meshes or FaceGen are involved.
- **1b. One generic topic many NPCs share**, placed on three vanilla NPCs.
  This tests how FO3/FNV's "any NPC whose conditions pass can say it" maps onto
  FO4's alias-based scenes.
- **Gate:** if 1b can't be generated without hand work, stop and rethink
  before any asset work.

### <a id="spike-1-design"></a>1a as built (text only)

Generator: `py -3.14 -m fo4_import.spike.dialogue --export <FNV export> --out <esp>`
(`fo4_import/spike/`). Source view: `tools/dialog/tes4_ctda_dump.py --names fnv --npc DocMitchell`.

**Source.** Doc's menu conversation is the `VFreeformGoodSpringsDocMitchell*`
topics plus the shared doctor services. His very first lines (waking up) are
scripted `SayTo` chains (`VCG01Intro`), not the menu, and are not part of 1a.

**How XDI decides** (its source, `reg2k/xdi` `src/DialogueEx.cpp`, and the
`Neanka/DialogueMenu` AS3):

- Every non-empty player INFO in the action's four player topics is an option.
- Options whose conditions fail are hidden, as are options with empty response
  text.
- Player INFOs are tested with the player as Subject and the NPC as Target.
- NPC response INFOs pair with player INFOs by position. Empty player INFOs are
  padding, and the response is the first passing NPC INFO in the option's range.
- Say Once player and NPC INFOs drop out once said.

**Mapping.**

| FNV | FO4 |
|---|---|
| Topic list (GREETING with no choices) | One XDI scene per menu, one phase `Menu`, one Player Dialogue action; PTOP holds the options, NPOT the responses, NTOP/NETO/QTOP empty (XDI reads all four) |
| A topic's INFOs, consecutive ones with the same prompt | One option; its INFOs become the NPC responses behind padding, so the first passing one answers (FNV's rule) |
| INFOs with different prompts (skill-check variants) | One option each. Each later option also gets "no earlier option could be chosen": the earlier INFO's negated conditions as one OR-group, plus "it has been said" for a Say Once one |
| Prompt (`RNAM`), else topic name | Player INFO response text and `RNAM` |
| Choices | Their own scene; the NPC INFO's `TSCE` points there |
| Goodbye | No `TSCE`, and End Running Scene (XDI's door icon) |
| Any other line | `TSCE` back to the menu scene, phase `Menu` |
| Top-level topic | Always offered |
| AddTopic | INFO `TIQS` on end sets a quest stage; the added topic's option needs `GetStageDone` |
| "Has been said" (no FO4 condition for it) | INFO `TIQS` on begin sets a stage |
| Line of a stopped quest | Left out (FNV only speaks lines of running quests) |
| Conditions | Function by name (`GetActorValue` → `GetValue`); actor values by name (limb conditions, Rads); FNV skills → plugin actor values `FNV_<Skill>`. Player-line conditions swap Subject and Target. Anything unconvertible drops the line, and the report names it |
| GREETING lines | An FO4 greeting topic (`GREE`); each line starts the menu scene |

**Assumed state** (quests not converted here): just after character creation.
VCG01 is finished, and Doc's script variable 4 is 0. VMS16 and VMS16b are not
started, so the bandit-shootout and injured-man topics are absent.

**Built (2026-10-05):** 87 records. The main menu has 15 options, including the
four Medicine/Speech variants, the two added topics, the doctor services and
their pay/decline sub-menus. One line is left out (an unconverted quest
variable), and result scripts are not converted (8 lines: items, healing).

**Played (2026-10-05).** First build: the greeting opened a pay sub-menu, and
sub-menu answers looped to themselves. Both went to "the first scene built"
instead of the main menu; the main menu now has a fixed id. Second build: the
greeting opens the menu, and all of Doc's options show. Also confirmed:
- an added topic appears after its AddTopic line, and a Say Once prompt gives
  way to the next variant ("…one more time?");
- the Medicine/Speech variants follow FNV's first-passing rule as the skills
  change;
- a doctor service answers by condition (full health: "nothing wrong") and
  returns to the main list;
- Goodbye ends the conversation.

A "Hi" before the greeting is the player character's own greeting line. FNV's
player is silent, so it needs suppressing (open).

### <a id="spike-1b"></a>1b: one scene for many speakers

Generator: `fo4_import/spike/dialogue.py` (replaces `doc_dialogue.py`; 1a's
behavior is kept).

**How vanilla FO4 does it.** `DialogueGenericDoctors` (`0005F76B`) has one
alias, `Doctor`, that is optional and has no fill rule (`FNAM=2`). Its greeting
lines carry `ALFA=0` (Forced Alias) and a scene to start (`TSCE`). Whoever is
greeted is pushed into the alias, and the scene runs with them. All 122
vanilla INFOs with `ALFA` also carry `TSCE`.

**What FNV's menu topics are like.** Almost all lines are per-NPC (GetIsID).
Only a handful of top-level menu topics have lines that name no NPC:
- Lucky 38's robots (`HD00*`) and casino cashiers, by faction;
- followers, by voice type;
- the water beggar;
- Goodbye.

A shared topic like `DoctorMedical` still keys each line to one doctor.

**Mapping added for 1b:**

| FNV | FO4 |
|---|---|
| Several speakers | One quest with one optional, empty alias. Every greeting line has `ALFA=0` and starts the menu scene; the options are tested against the speaker |
| Quest dialogue conditions (the line picker checks them first) | ANDed onto every line of the quest; `GenericKids`' child-only Goodbyes no longer reach adults |
| Same prompt anywhere in a topic | One option (FNV shows a topic once) |
| An option with several variants | Gated by an OR of the variants' speaker tests (GetIsID, GetInFaction); ungated only if a variant has none |
| Random piles | `GetRandomPercent < 100/remaining` chained down the pile, and FO4's Random flag left off. XDI answers with the first passing line and has a "TODO: handle Random"; with the flag on, the robot butler's jokes never played |
| Tab (leave at any time) | A last `[Leave]` option on every menu: a silent `...` with End Running Scene. XDI's `DialogueMenu.as` `ProcessUserEvent` takes every key press while the list is up, so Tab never reaches the game. On a main menu it is hidden while a GOODBYE-topic option shows (the Goodbye options' conditions, negated) |
| Walking away (FNV has no equivalent; a talk always starts fresh) | The `Menu` phase completes on `GetDistance(Player) > 500` run on the alias, the same 500 as the scene's dialogue distance (`ACTV`). Without it the scene waited, and the menu reopened when the player came back. 127 vanilla phases end on a `GetDistance` this way |
| `GetPCIsSex` | `GetIsSex` run on the player reference |
| A speaker with no FNV greeting | A silent `...` greeting, last in the topic (FNV opens the topic list without one) |
| A condition settled by the test world | A speaker test naming no test speaker is false; a null form parameter is false (FNV's `GetInCell(NULL)` makes Doctor Barrows' `DoctorMedical` lines unplayable in FNV itself) |

**Test world.** Doc Mitchell → Doc Weathers; Doctor Barrows → Doctor Amari
(`0009A680`); a Lucky 38 robot butler → `WorkshopVendorBar01` (`00192356`),
with `HD00RoboButler` mapped to his `REMerchantBarVendorFaction`. All three
stand in `QASmoke`. Two stand-in traps:
- a unique NPC whose packages point elsewhere leaves the cell. Doctor Duff's
  all point to Diamond City, and she was gone on arrival; pick a base with no
  packages or only `DefaultSandboxInteriorUnlockDoors`;
- a faction listed at rank -1 (`FF`) is not membership. The vendor's
  `WorkshopVendorFactionBar` is -1 until a settlement assigns him, so
  `GetInFaction` failed and his vanilla greeting played.

**Played (2026-10-05), passed:**
- each speaker sees only their own options, all from one scene;
- Amari leaves through `[Leave]`;
- the vendor's time-of-day greeting, drink, haircut and Goodbye work, and his
  jokes play and vary;
- walking away ends the talk, and coming back does not reopen it.

Also fixed on the way: `tools/generators/gen_ctda_param_types.py` missed 108
of FO4's parameter types, because xEdit's FO4 file spells `Paramtype` in 100
entries. The match is now case-insensitive; the TES5, FNV, FO3 and TES4 tables
come out identical.

**Follow-up: one place for the way out.** Today Goodbye sits where its topic
falls (first on the main menu) and `[Leave]` is always last, so the exit moves
between menus. Put Goodbye and `[Leave]` in the same fixed slot on every menu,
top or bottom (check where FNV's topic list puts GOODBYE before choosing). Later,
give both the same name; they keep different names while testing, so a
play-test shows which one appeared.

Not covered yet: voice, the player's own "Hi" before a greeting, and the force
greet (Doc's menu conversation has none).

## <a id="spike-3"></a>Spike 3: one script

Convert one FNV terminal or object script, emit FO4 Papyrus, and compile it
with FO4's compiler. Hydra (in the MO2 instance) logs broken script linkage
in game. Answers: the size of the FO4 command-row table and of VMAD for FO4.

## <a id="spike-2"></a>Spike 2: one interior cell

Doc Mitchell's house:

- statics, lights and doors;
- meshes through a minimal FO4 mesh writer plus BGSM/BGEM materials;
- textures re-encoded;
- FaceGen for Doc from the CK;
- no precombines.

fnv-to-fo4's format facts serve as a checklist
([research](research/fo4_target.md#fnv-to-fo4)), with NifSkope 2.0.dev11's
`nif.xml` as the layout reference.

## <a id="decision"></a>Decision point

After spikes 1–3: the architecture plan (the `fo4_import` package, the asset
writers, the script back end, the runtime), or a stop.

## <a id="test-setup"></a>Test setup

MO2 instance `C:\Modlists\fo3fnv-in-fo4`. Spikes run in a minimal `Spike`
profile, one change per test:

- the game and DLC;
- F4SE, the Address Library and MCM;
- XDI and LevelUpMenuEx;
- Addictol (crash logger, with its engine fixes off if its INI allows);
- Hydra.

UFO4P and the engine-fix mods stay in the `Default`/`Play` profile, because
they edit vanilla records and engine code a spike may be measuring. Generated
plugins never master UFO4P. Vanilla censuses read the game's own
`Fallout4.esm` (the dump above), not MO2's merged view.
