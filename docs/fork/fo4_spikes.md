# FO4 spikes: deciding whether FO3/FNV on Fallout 4 is buildable

Design only; status is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The findings behind this
plan are in [research/fo4_target.md](research/fo4_target.md).

## <a id="order"></a>Order and why

Spikes come before more exe reading. The [AI rules](research/fo4_target.md#ai-rules)
read so far settled the one question exe work could decide: FO4's AI
decisions are Skyrim's. The questions that could still sink the project are
on the content side, ordered by how decisive each is:

1. **Dialogue (spike 1).** Can FO3/FNV dialogue be generated for FO4 at all?
   This is go/no-go.
2. **Scripts (spike 3).** How big is the script back end? Runs in parallel
   with spike 1 and needs none of your play time.
3. **Assets (spike 2).** What does the mesh/material/collision/FaceGen back end
   really cost? Only worth paying for once spike 1 passes.

Exe reading resumes where a spike needs it. Spike 1 plays a force greet, which
settles R10 by observation.

## <a id="step-0"></a>Step 0: groundwork

| Piece | What |
|---|---|
| FO4 plugin writer | `fo4_import/base/writer.py`: `FO4PluginWriter` (form version 131, FO4 header with HEDR 1.0, INTV and INCC, FO4 top-level group order), plus `pack_quest()` / `pack_topic()` for FO4's nesting. Dialogue has no top-level group: each QUST is followed by a quest-children group (type 10) holding DLBR, then DIAL with its INFO group (type 7), then SCEN, in vanilla's order. Tests: `tests/test_fo4_writer.py` |
| Vanilla dump | `references/Fallout4.esm/`: all 138 record types, 558 MB, from `tools/esm/tes5_esm_reader.py --generic`. The `--generic` switch skips the tool's Skyrim field layouts and condition names, so FO4 fields show as raw FormID/uint/float/hex rather than mislabelled Skyrim fields. FO4-specific decoders get added as spikes need them |
| Script sources | `references/fo4_scripts/Base` (Base, the six DLC and Creation Club zips, 10,258 files, with `Institute_Papyrus_Flags.flg`) and `references/fo4_scripts/F4SE` (29 files). Import order: F4SE first, then Base |
| Compiler | Fallout 4's own `Papyrus Compiler\PapyrusCompiler.exe`. A smoke script with a struct, a timer and F4SE's `Form.GetEditorID` compiles. The vendored `external/papyrus-compiler/papyrus.exe` is Skyrim-only: it stops at the first `Struct` |

Known gap: `tes5_import.base.tes5_reader.walk(raw, b'DIAL')` (a *filtered*
walk) prunes group type 10 as Skyrim cell children, so it misses every FO4
topic. Unfiltered walks, and the dump tool, see them. An FO4 reader needs its
own child-group table.

## <a id="spike-1"></a>Spike 1: dialogue (go/no-go)

Generated from the FNV export by code, not built by hand in the CK.

- **1a. Doc Mitchell's opening conversation**, as XDI-enabled scenes:
  - the topic list, with more than four options;
  - SPECIAL and skill checks;
  - a silent player;
  - the force greet, played, to settle R10;
  - his voice lines as `.fuz` with lip data.

  The speaker is a vanilla FO4 NPC base in a test cell, so no converted
  meshes or FaceGen are involved.
- **1b. One generic topic many NPCs share**, placed on three vanilla NPCs.
  This tests how FO3/FNV's "any NPC whose conditions pass can say it" maps onto
  FO4's alias-based scenes.
- **Gate:** if 1b can't be generated without hand work, stop and rethink
  before any asset work.

### <a id="spike-1-design"></a>1a as built (text only)

Generator: `py -3.14 -m fo4_import.spike.dialogue --export <FNV export> --out <esp>`
(`fo4_import/spike/`). Source view: `tools/dialog/tes4_ctda_dump.py --names fnv --npc DocMitchell`.

**Source.** Doc's menu conversation is the `VFreeformGoodSpringsDocMitchell*`
topics plus the shared doctor services. His very first lines (waking up) are
scripted `SayTo` chains (`VCG01Intro`), not the menu, and are not part of 1a.

**How XDI decides** (its source, `reg2k/xdi` `src/DialogueEx.cpp`, and the
`Neanka/DialogueMenu` AS3):

- Every non-empty player INFO in the action's four player topics is an option.
- Options whose conditions fail are hidden, as are options with empty response
  text.
- Player INFOs are tested with the player as Subject and the NPC as Target.
- NPC response INFOs pair with player INFOs by position. Empty player INFOs are
  padding, and the response is the first passing NPC INFO in the option's range.
- Say Once player and NPC INFOs drop out once said.

**Mapping.**

| FNV | FO4 |
|---|---|
| Topic list (GREETING with no choices) | One XDI scene per menu, one phase `Menu`, one Player Dialogue action; PTOP holds the options, NPOT the responses, NTOP/NETO/QTOP empty (XDI reads all four) |
| A topic's INFOs, consecutive ones with the same prompt | One option; its INFOs become the NPC responses behind padding, so the first passing one answers (FNV's rule) |
| INFOs with different prompts (skill-check variants) | One option each. Each later option also gets "no earlier option could be chosen": the earlier INFO's negated conditions as one OR-group, plus "it has been said" for a Say Once one |
| Prompt (`RNAM`), else topic name | Player INFO response text and `RNAM` |
| Choices | Their own scene; the NPC INFO's `TSCE` points there |
| Goodbye | No `TSCE`, and End Running Scene (XDI's door icon) |
| Any other line | `TSCE` back to the menu scene, phase `Menu` |
| Top-level topic | Always offered |
| AddTopic | INFO `TIQS` on end sets a quest stage; the added topic's option needs `GetStageDone` |
| "Has been said" (no FO4 condition for it) | INFO `TIQS` on begin sets a stage |
| Line of a stopped quest | Left out (FNV only speaks lines of running quests) |
| Conditions | Function by name (`GetActorValue` → `GetValue`); actor values by name (limb conditions, Rads); FNV skills → plugin actor values `FNV_<Skill>`. Player-line conditions swap Subject and Target. Anything unconvertible drops the line, and the report names it |
| GREETING lines | An FO4 greeting topic (`GREE`); each line starts the menu scene |

**Assumed state** (quests not converted here): just after character creation.
VCG01 is finished, and Doc's script variable 4 is 0. VMS16 and VMS16b are not
started, so the bandit-shootout and injured-man topics are absent.

**Built (2026-10-05):** 87 records. The main menu has 15 options, including the
four Medicine/Speech variants, the two added topics, the doctor services and
their pay/decline sub-menus. One line is left out (an unconverted quest
variable), and result scripts are not converted (8 lines: items, healing).

**Played (2026-10-05).** First build: the greeting opened a pay sub-menu, and
sub-menu answers looped to themselves. Both went to "the first scene built"
instead of the main menu; the main menu now has a fixed id. Second build: the
greeting opens the menu, and all of Doc's options show. Also confirmed:
- an added topic appears after its AddTopic line, and a Say Once prompt gives
  way to the next variant ("…one more time?");
- the Medicine/Speech variants follow FNV's first-passing rule as the skills
  change;
- a doctor service answers by condition (full health: "nothing wrong") and
  returns to the main list;
- Goodbye ends the conversation.

A "Hi" before the greeting is the player character's own greeting line. FNV's
player is silent, so it needs suppressing (open). Looked at 2026-10-05, left
until it causes a problem:
- FO4 has no player-greeting subtype. The line is most likely
  `DialogueGenericPlayer` (`000179EF`)'s Hello topic (`00018184`, HELO, 52
  INFOs);
- 49 of the 52 have no conditions, and the other 3 only test combat, dying
  and keywords, so there is no global or setting to switch them off;
- likely fix: a player HELO line in our own quest (priority 90 against
  vanilla's) that wins for our speakers and says nothing. Untested: whether
  FO4 accepts an INFO with no response or shows a "..." subtitle. No
  vanilla edit;
- alternative (outside research): silent voice files over the player's
  Hello lines, as [mod 5702](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5702)
  does for other player voices. Loose
  `Sound\Voice\Fallout4.esm\PlayerVoice{Male,Female}01\<INFO>_1.fuz` files
  for topic `00018184`'s 52 INFOs; no record changes. Open: whether the
  line's subtitle still shows, and it silences those hellos everywhere
  (fine for a game where the player is silent).

### <a id="spike-1b"></a>1b: one scene for many speakers

Generator: `fo4_import/spike/dialogue.py` (replaces `doc_dialogue.py`; 1a's
behavior is kept).

**How vanilla FO4 does it.** `DialogueGenericDoctors` (`0005F76B`) has one
alias, `Doctor`, that is optional and has no fill rule (`FNAM=2`). Its greeting
lines carry `ALFA=0` (Forced Alias) and a scene to start (`TSCE`). Whoever is
greeted is pushed into the alias, and the scene runs with them. All 122
vanilla INFOs with `ALFA` also carry `TSCE`.

**What FNV's menu topics are like.** Almost all lines are per-NPC (GetIsID).
Only a handful of top-level menu topics have lines that name no NPC:
- Lucky 38's robots (`HD00*`) and casino cashiers, by faction;
- followers, by voice type;
- the water beggar;
- Goodbye.

A shared topic like `DoctorMedical` still keys each line to one doctor.

**Mapping added for 1b:**

| FNV | FO4 |
|---|---|
| Several speakers | One quest with one optional, empty alias. Every greeting line has `ALFA=0` and starts the menu scene; the options are tested against the speaker |
| Quest dialogue conditions (the line picker checks them first) | ANDed onto every line of the quest; `GenericKids`' child-only Goodbyes no longer reach adults |
| Same prompt anywhere in a topic | One option (FNV shows a topic once) |
| An option with several variants | Gated by an OR of the variants' speaker tests (GetIsID, GetInFaction); ungated only if a variant has none |
| Random piles | `GetRandomPercent < 100/remaining` chained down the pile, and FO4's Random flag left off. XDI answers with the first passing line and has a "TODO: handle Random"; with the flag on, the robot butler's jokes never played |
| Tab (leave at any time) | A last `[Leave]` option on every menu: a silent `...` with End Running Scene. XDI's `DialogueMenu.as` `ProcessUserEvent` takes every key press while the list is up, so Tab never reaches the game. On a main menu it is hidden while a GOODBYE-topic option shows (the Goodbye options' conditions, negated) |
| Walking away (FNV has no equivalent; a talk always starts fresh) | The `Menu` phase completes on `GetDistance(Player) > 500` run on the alias, the same 500 as the scene's dialogue distance (`ACTV`). Without it the scene waited, and the menu reopened when the player came back. 127 vanilla phases end on a `GetDistance` this way |
| `GetPCIsSex` | `GetIsSex` run on the player reference |
| A speaker with no FNV greeting | A silent `...` greeting, last in the topic (FNV opens the topic list without one) |
| Only the player opens a talk (FNV NPCs do it only by force greet) | Every greeting line needs `GetPlayerActivated == 1` on the speaker, as 71 vanilla scene greetings have. Without it an NPC idling near the player said the greeting unasked, and it started the menu. A converted force greet will need a greeting without it |
| A condition settled by the test world | A speaker test naming no test speaker is false; a null form parameter is false (FNV's `GetInCell(NULL)` makes Doctor Barrows' `DoctorMedical` lines unplayable in FNV itself) |

**Test world.** Doc Mitchell → Doc Weathers; Doctor Barrows → Doctor Amari
(`0009A680`); a Lucky 38 robot butler → `WorkshopVendorBar01` (`00192356`),
with `HD00RoboButler` mapped to his `REMerchantBarVendorFaction`. All three
stand in `QASmoke`. Two stand-in traps:
- a unique NPC whose packages point elsewhere leaves the cell. Doctor Duff's
  all point to Diamond City, and she was gone on arrival; pick a base with no
  packages or only `DefaultSandboxInteriorUnlockDoors`;
- a faction listed at rank -1 (`FF`) is not membership. The vendor's
  `WorkshopVendorFactionBar` is -1 until a settlement assigns him, so
  `GetInFaction` failed and his vanilla greeting played;
- a stand-in keeps its own vanilla dialogue. Once ours needs the player to
  start the talk, Doc Weathers greets unasked with `DialogueGenericDoctors`'
  scene greetings, which have no activation check. Converted NPCs have no
  vanilla dialogue, so this is test-only.

**Played (2026-10-05), passed:**
- each speaker sees only their own options, all from one scene;
- Amari leaves through `[Leave]`;
- the vendor's time-of-day greeting, drink, haircut and Goodbye work, and his
  jokes play and vary;
- walking away ends the talk, and coming back does not reopen it.

Also fixed on the way: `tools/generators/gen_ctda_param_types.py` missed 108
of FO4's parameter types, because xEdit's FO4 file spells `Paramtype` in 100
entries. The match is now case-insensitive; the TES5, FNV, FO3 and TES4 tables
come out identical.

### <a id="spike-1-voice"></a>Voice

`--data <Data folder>` also writes the lines' voice (`fo4_import/spike/voice.py`).

- **Path:** FO4 finds a line at
  `Sound\Voice\<plugin>\<speaker's voice type>\<INFO FormID, load-order byte 00>_<n>.fuz`
  (the vanilla `Fallout4 - Voices.ba2` names its files the same way).
- **Source:** FNV files are `<quest>_<topic>_<INFO id>_<n>.ogg` in the
  speaker's voice-type folder. Each speaker maps that folder to the stand-in's
  FO4 voice type (`VOICES`), and a line gets a file wherever FNV recorded it.
- **Conversion:** the shared `convert_file_to_xwm` with the FO4 CK's own
  `Tools\LipGen\LipGenerator\` `LipGenerator.exe` and `xWMAEncode.exe` (same
  command line as Skyrim's). The `.fuz` is the same `FUZE` v1 container, and
  the lip header matches vanilla's.
- **Transcript:** response text with bracketed tags (`[SUCCEEDED]`) removed;
  the subtitles keep them, as FNV's do.

Built 2026-10-05: 41 files, 40 on Doc's lines and 1 on Barrows'. FNV has no
recordings for `HD00`'s robot butler lines. **Played:** Doc speaks in Doc
Mitchell's voice with moving lips.

### <a id="spike-1-force-greet"></a>Force greet (designed, not built)

FO3/FNV force greets play the same GREETING lines the player gets by
talking. FO3's Amata: `CG04AmataForceGreet` is a Dialogue package targeting
the player (`00000014`, 150 units) with type Conversation and no topic, so it
opens with her stage-conditioned greetings (`MS16AmataGreetPlayer` and
`CG02AmataGreetPlayerBeginning` look like the same kind by name).

Every generated greeting needs `GetPlayerActivated == 1`, which would leave a
converted force greet with nothing to say. Plan:

- the greeting check becomes `GetPlayerActivated == 1` **OR**
  `GetIsCurrentPackage(<FO4 copy of one of the speaker's force-greet packages>)`
  on the speaker, taken from the package records. Unprompted NPCs stay
  blocked; only authored grabs open a talk;
- the FO3/FNV Dialogue package becomes an FO4 force-greet package
  (`BGSProcedureForceGreet` exists);
- records only, no DLL.

Open, for a play-test (a FO3 force greet like Amata's is the natural spike-1
force-greet test):
- [R10](research/fo4_target.md#ai-rules): FO4's greet probably lasts until the
  talk ends, as FO3's does, so the package would still be current when the
  greeting is picked. Unconfirmed;
- whether `GetIsCurrentPackage` holds at that moment.

**Follow-up: one place for the way out.** Today Goodbye sits where its topic
falls (first on the main menu) and `[Leave]` is always last, so the exit moves
between menus. Put Goodbye and `[Leave]` in the same fixed slot on every menu,
top or bottom (check where FNV's topic list puts GOODBYE before choosing). Later,
give both the same name; they keep different names while testing, so a
play-test shows which one appeared.

Not covered yet: voice, the player's own "Hi" before a greeting, and the force
greet (Doc's menu conversation has none).

## <a id="spike-3"></a>Spike 3: one script

Convert one FNV terminal or object script, emit FO4 Papyrus, and compile it
with FO4's compiler. Hydra (in the MO2 instance) logs broken script linkage
in game. Answers: the size of the FO4 command-row table and of VMAD for FO4.

### <a id="spike-3-measured"></a>Measured (2026-10-05)

Corpus: the Skyrim pipeline's 17,703 converted FNV scripts
(`tes4skyrim_standalone/output/FalloutNV.esm/scripts/source`; 14,155 are
dialogue fragments `TIF__*`), compiled unchanged with FO4's
`PapyrusCompiler.exe` (imports F4SE, Base, the corpus and our 17
`static_scripts`). The compiler scans its working directory and fails on a
path over 260 characters, so run it from a short folder.

**A random 199 (149 object/quest scripts, 50 fragments):**

| Result | Scripts |
|---|---|
| Compile unchanged | 81 (all object/quest) |
| Fail only through a helper script (`TES4Polyfill` pulls in helpers that do not compile) | 54 (47 fragments) |
| Fail on their own code | 64 (3 fragments) |

**What fails, by kind** (errors in the sample; every one has an FO4 native
except `SetDontMove`):

| Skyrim (as we emit it) | Errors / scripts | FO4 |
|---|---|---|
| `RegisterForSingleUpdate` + `Event OnUpdate` (our GameMode loop) | 155 / 28+ | `StartTimer` + `Event OnTimer(int)`; `StartTimerGameTime` for `OnUpdateGameTime` |
| `Get`/`Set`/`Restore`/`Damage`/`Mod`/`ForceActorValue("Name")` | 52+ | `GetValue`/`SetValue`/`RestoreValue`/`DamageValue`/`ModValue(ActorValue)` on ObjectReference: an `ActorValue` property per name. Helpers that take the name as a string need a name → form lookup |
| `SendModEvent` (SKSE) | 10 | `CustomEvent` + `SendCustomEvent` |
| `Game.Disable`/`EnablePlayerControls` | 3 | `InputEnableLayer` (create, disable, delete) |
| `Debug.SendAnimationEvent` | 3 | `PlayIdle` (Actor) / `PlayAnimation` (ObjectReference) |
| `Event OnHit` parameters | 5 | FO4 adds `akTarget` first and needs `RegisterForHitEvent`, renewed after each hit |
| `Event OnTrigger`, menu and sleep events | 6 | no `OnTrigger`; `RegisterForMenuOpenCloseEvent`, `RegisterForPlayerSleep` |
| `SetDontMove` | 4 | none; `SetRestrained` is the nearest |
| A function variable shadowing a script variable (`TES4_CombatQueue`) | 2 | FO4's compiler rejects it; rename |

**The command-row table:** 20 of the 554 rows emit a call FO4 lacks (8 of
them `SendModEvent`, the rest actor values, `Debug.SendAnimationEvent`,
`Game.EnableFastTravel`, `SetDontMove`). The rest of the Skyrim API is
written by about 10 other converter files (handlers, event assembly, blocks),
so an FO4 target is a target-API layer across those, not a row swap.

**VMAD:** small. FO4 is version 6 (Skyrim 5), the same object format and
property layout plus struct types (7, 17). A fragment block starts with bind
data version 3 (Skyrim 2) and embeds a full script entry with its properties
where Skyrim has a file name; vanilla FO4 INFOs attach no other scripts.
Fragment scripts are namespaced (`Fragments:TopicInfos:TIF_<quest>_<id>`).
Five builders in `script_convert/pipeline.py` change.

### <a id="spike-3-target"></a>The target switch (in progress)

`script_convert/target.py` picks the game a run emits Papyrus for (Skyrim by
default, Fallout 4 with `convert_scripts_subset.py --target fallout4`),
through the environment so worker processes inherit it. The converter keeps
Skyrim's spelling internally, because event headers double as merge keys and
comparison values. Where FO4 differs, the converter builds the target's form
directly; nothing rewrites emitted text:

| Construct | How |
|---|---|
| Update loop | `event_opener` (`OnUpdate` → `OnTimer(int)`), `arm_update` (`RegisterForSingleUpdate` → `StartTimer`), `run_update_now` |
| `OnHit` | FO4 opener; `RegisterForHitEvent(Self)` at start (`lifecycle`) and first in the event, since one registration delivers one hit |
| Actor values | `av_call`: `GetValue(TES4AV_<name>)` etc. with an `ActorValue` property per name |
| Row templates | `command_rows_fallout4.FALLOUT4_ROWS`, keyed by the Skyrim `Cmd`, picked by `emit_row` (9 rows so far) |
| Animation events | `anim_event_call`: `PlayAnimation` |
| Player controls | `controls_call`: the FO4-only helper `static_scripts/fallout4/TES4_PlayerControls` holds the one shared `InputEnableLayer` |
| Tables | `FALLOUT4_EVENTS`, `FALLOUT4_AV_NATIVES` in `constants.py` |

Skyrim output is byte-identical (Doc's script against the pipeline's; 579
converter tests pass). `arch_fitness` matches `HEAD` except +8 branch points
and +93 code lines.

**Doc Mitchell's `GSDocMitchellScript` compiles with FO4's compiler**
(2026-10-05), emitted by the converter with no hand edits. It needed the
update loop, `OnHit`, actor values, player controls and an animation event,
plus one shared-helper fix (`TES4_CombatQueue` locals renamed: FO4's compiler
rejects a local that shadows a script variable).

**Helpers:** FO4's compiler checks only the declarations of the scripts a
script uses, so Doc compiles while helper bodies still fail. Compiled alone,
11 of 18 helpers pass. The 7 left:

| Helper | FO4 rejects |
|---|---|
| `TES4Polyfill` | about 75 actor-value calls by name, many with the name in a variable (needs a name → ActorValue lookup); SKSE `SendModEvent`, `GetModByName`; Skyrim's vampire quest; `IsPlayable` |
| `TES4_DialoguePause` | SKSE menu events and cell reference walking |
| `TES4_CombatQueue`, `TES4_DayClock` | the update loop (`OnUpdate`, `OnUpdateGameTime`) |
| `TES4_StagePackageAlias` | SKSE mod events |
| `TES4_BoundItemEffect` | SKSE `GetEquippedArmorInSlot` |
| `TES4_Terminal` | one actor-value read |

Not yet done: the 7 helpers, the pipeline (FO4 static-script set, FO4 VMAD,
filling `TES4AV_*` and `TES4PlayerControls`), and re-running the 199-script
sample under the FO4 target.

## <a id="spike-2"></a>Spike 2: one interior cell

Doc Mitchell's house:

- statics, lights and doors;
- meshes through a minimal FO4 mesh writer plus BGSM/BGEM materials;
- textures re-encoded;
- FaceGen for Doc from the CK;
- no precombines.

fnv-to-fo4's format facts serve as a checklist
([research](research/fo4_target.md#fnv-to-fo4)), with NifSkope 2.0.dev11's
`nif.xml` as the layout reference.

## <a id="decision"></a>Decision point

After spikes 1–3: the architecture plan (the `fo4_import` package, the asset
writers, the script back end, the runtime), or a stop.

## <a id="test-setup"></a>Test setup

MO2 instance `C:\Modlists\fo3fnv-in-fo4`. Spikes run in a minimal `Spike`
profile, one change per test:

- the game and DLC;
- F4SE, the Address Library and MCM;
- XDI and LevelUpMenuEx;
- Addictol (crash logger, with its engine fixes off if its INI allows);
- Hydra.

UFO4P and the engine-fix mods stay in the `Default`/`Play` profile, because
they edit vanilla records and engine code a spike may be measuring. Generated
plugins never master UFO4P. Vanilla censuses read the game's own
`Fallout4.esm` (the dump above), not MO2's merged view.
